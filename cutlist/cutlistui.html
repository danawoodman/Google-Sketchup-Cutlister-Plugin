The application now supports metric as well as Imperial units.  Those used in the table will be metric if your drawing uses metric units.<BR><BR>" +

"<BR>"+
"1) Create your object aligned to the main axes.<BR>"+
"2) Select the whole object.<BR>"+
"3) Create a component for this object. (Not a group, groups ignore axes.)<BR>"+
"4) Triple click this component so that the object is selected within it.<BR>"+
"5) Create a second nested component!<BR>"+
"6) Now you can copy and rotate the top level component and the inner component will retain its correct dimensions. The inner component is now relative to the outer component rather than the drawing axes.<BR>"+
"7) Apply materials and descriptions you want to use to the inner component.<BR>"+
"8) Components that are already nested within another component should work fine.<BR>"+

"1) Change them to components from groups if necessary.<BR>"+
"2) Triple click them to select the inner object.<BR>"+
"3) Create a nested component as described above.<BR>"+
"4) When you create this nested component you will see a blue bounding box that is not ligned up with you rotated object. This is what is being measured rather than your object.<BR>"+
"5) Select the inner component, right click on it, and select change axes.<BR>"+
"6) Set the axes along the edges of your component.<BR>"+
"7) The dimensions should now show up correctly.<BR>"+

"c) Copy, move and rotate the outer component.<BR>"+

If left unchecked, then material will be ignored and all parts will be placed on a generic 'default' material. If checked, then the layout will split parts into different materials and parts will only be placed on a board or sheet of material matching the material name of the part. You might leave this unchecked if you haven't paid much attention to setting material type and you just want to know how the parts would be laid out assuming they are all the same material."
